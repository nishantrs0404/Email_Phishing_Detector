# PhishGuard AI — Real-Time Phishing Email Detector

A Chrome extension that protects Gmail users from phishing attacks using
Machine Learning, NLP analysis, and hybrid threat scoring.

---

## Overview

Phishing remains one of the most prevalent cybersecurity threats, with
attackers increasingly using sophisticated techniques to bypass traditional
defenses. PhishGuard AI addresses this challenge by combining a trained
Machine Learning classifier with NLP-based analysis to detect malicious
URLs directly within Gmail — before users click them.

The system operates in real-time, analyzing email content as users view
their inbox, providing immediate visual warnings and click-blocking
protection for dangerous links.

### Core Capabilities

- Real-time URL scanning inside Gmail emails
- Random Forest classifier trained on 549,000 URLs (94.91% ROC-AUC)
- Hybrid scoring combining ML predictions with NLP keyword analysis
- Click blocking for confirmed dangerous links
- Live dashboard showing scanning statistics and threat summaries
- 23/23 automated API tests ensuring reliability

## Core Detection Logic

### Feature Engineering (17 URL Features)

- Length-based: URL length, slash count, dot count, digit count
- Character signals: hyphens, special characters, @ symbol, double slash
- Security indicators: HTTPS usage, raw IP address, port number, punycode
- Domain analysis: subdomain count, suspicious TLD, brand in subdomain
- Advanced: Shannon entropy, suspicious keyword presence

### NLP Keyword Analysis

Weighted keyword scoring across 5 categories:
- Urgency triggers (weight: 3)
- Account threats (weight: 4)
- Financial terms (weight: 3)
- Action demands (weight: 2)
- Direct threats (weight: 5)

### Hybrid Scoring
```
ML probability + NLP boost (if score >= 10: +0.15, if >= 5: +0.08)

>= 0.75  -->  DANGEROUS
>= 0.50  -->  SUSPICIOUS
>= 0.35  -->  LOW RISK
 < 0.35  -->  SAFE
```

## Challenges and Solutions

**Real-Time Performance**
Challenge: Maintaining under 200ms latency while running ML inference.
Solution: Optimized feature extraction, model serialization with joblib,
and whitelist bypass for trusted domains.

**Gmail DOM Stability**
Challenge: Gmail's dynamic content loading made link detection unreliable.
Solution: Implemented MutationObserver to detect DOM changes and trigger
re-scanning on new content.

**False Positive Management**
Challenge: Legitimate marketing links flagged as suspicious.
Solution: Domain whitelist for trusted providers and threshold tuning
at 0.35 to optimize recall-precision tradeoff.

## Future Improvements

| Priority | Feature |
|---|---|
| High | VirusTotal API integration |
| High | Domain age WHOIS scoring |
| Medium | User feedback loop for model retraining |
| Medium | Docker containerized deployment |
| Low | Outlook and Yahoo Mail support |
| Low | Centralized threat analytics dashboard |
